# Multi-step Wizard form with JSON columns

With the advent of JSON columns in MySQL 5.7 and Postgres a multistep model can be saved with each step in its own column.  This repo requires Rails 5
and MySQL 5.7 or later.

Abstracted from [this repo](https://github.com/nerdcave/rails-multistep-form),
I've added the ability to save and validate separate JSON columns.  


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
